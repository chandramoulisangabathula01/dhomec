Color	Black

Lince was developed to automate swing gates, available in 230V, 110V and 24V and three different courses – 300mm, 400mm and 600mm.


As a rule, these types of motors are manufactured to be installed only on one side of the gate, with the right and left motor. With LINCE, this does not happen.


In addition to being practical, safe and powerful, this automation allows the motor to be adapted from the left side, to the right side and vice versa. For this, you only have to reverse the direction of some parts and it becomes operational for the opposite side.


In addition to being functional for the installer, it is also one of the most economical solutions we have available for automating swing gates.
